# Image Captioning Project

This project builds an image captioning system by integrating a pre-trained ResNet18 CNN for feature extraction with an LSTM network for generating captions. Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, the model produces contextually relevant captions and is evaluated using BLEU scores.

## Key Features
- ResNet18 for image feature extraction
- LSTM for caption generation
- Evaluated using BLEU scores

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include integrating the CLIP model and expanding the dataset to improve the systemâ€™s performance.
